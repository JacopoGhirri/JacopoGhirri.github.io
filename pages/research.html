    <h3>Short term CO2 emission forecasts in the EU</h3>
    <p>A 55% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 is an ambitious goal, and disruptive trends are making it ever more challenging to forecast whether we are on track or not. <br>
    Traditional forecasting methods struggle in modeling a high amount of highly correlated variables. I am developing a Deep Learning solution capable of handling many emission drivers, and transition indicators, across the sectors of EU countries. <br>
        It will hence be possible to assess how traditionally computed scenarios compare with data-driven trend extrapolations.

    <h3>A new generation of Climate Scenarios</h3>
    <p>Integrates Assessment Models have long been pivotal in understanding the impacts, and shaping climate policies. They however face the limitations posed by the optimization framework often central to their architecture. <br>
        GFlowNets are a promising generative model architecture, and can help in exploring the wider space of mitigation strategies. Moving beyond an optimization framework can yield a more diverse set of feasible mitigation strategies, and assess the robustness of optimal solutions.</p>
